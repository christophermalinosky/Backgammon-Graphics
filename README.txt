How to Interact: 
	- Roll dice by pressing the "Roll" key. (Note: We didn't have time to implement our dice textures, we just have the animation + sound effect. The actual result is displayed in a <h3> element below the canvas)
	- Pieces can be moved by selecting a piece with Arrow Keys / WASD, pressing enter to select it, using Arrow Keys / WASD to select a new tile, and then pressing enter again. 
	- Perspective can be changed using the horizontal and vertical sliders, or by hitting the Player 1 Perspective / Player 2 Perspective button.
